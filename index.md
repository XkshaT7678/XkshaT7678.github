								<h2 class="major">Skills Necessary for Coding</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.png" alt="none" /></span>
								<p>At its heart, coding is expression and problem solving. You can focus on its applications, on programming languages, but no matter how you practice it, you’ll cultivate these two essential skills, which will help you in all aspects of life. Besides existential value, learning to code proficiently will offer you myriad job opportunities, the ability to create your own schedule/work from anywhere, high wages for less hours of labor, eager to please clients that need/search for your help, and much more. Coders have more time to work on their passions, side projects, and enjoy a sense of self-reliance most workers don’t. They spend their time making websites, applications, and systems work, while building real solutions, and improving experiences for end users and employers alike. Coders have enhanced focus, because the issues they tackle require sustained, concentrated effort. This leads to greater productivity in all sectors of life. One of the greatest benefits from coding is consistently entering a state of flow, in which time, distraction and frustration melts away, allowing the coder to form a union with the task at hand. For all these reasons, coding casually or professionally can improve your life. So how to begin? Here are some points that every coder needs to learn .</p>
								1.Self-Reliance<br>2.Language(Talking About Programming Language)<br>3.Logic -->  if (a condition evaluates to True):
								then do these things only for ‘True’
								else:
								otherwise do these things only for ‘False’.<br>4.Attention to Detail<br>5.Recognition of Stupidity<br>6.Abstract Thinking<br>7.Patience(It's A Main Point)<br>8.Strong Memory<br>9.Scientific Method<br>10.Communication and Empathy As IQ+EQ=SUCCESS

								<p>As i am a serious programmer . I Loves to play with the codes and make something cool stuff..
								<p>WHAT IS GITHUB AND WHY I LOVES IT?</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic06.png" alt="none" /></span>
								<p>GitHub, Inc. is an American multinational corporation that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.

									GitHub offers its basic services free of charge. Its more advanced professional and enterprise services are commercial. Free GitHub accounts are commonly used to host open-source projects. As of January 2019, GitHub offers unlimited private repositories to all plans, including free accounts, but allowed only up to three collaborators per repository for free. Starting from April 15, 2020, the free plan allows unlimited collaborators, but restricts private repositories to 2,000 actions minutes per month. As of January 2020, GitHub reports having over 40 million users and more than 100 million repositories (including at least 28 million public repositories),making it the largest host of source code in the world.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Why i love to code?</h3>
								<span class="image "><img src="images/pic05.png" width="360" height="360" alt="" /></span>
								<p> I love to code because it is usable art.
									Just like architecture, which is an art used by people daily and affects their everyday life, so is code. You can create something and people interact with, use, touch and work with. That is an amazing feeling</p>
